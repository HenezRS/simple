-- Class Weapons
Issue: Class sprites have static weapons drawn (e.g. knight has a sword). This limits weapon pool for classes
Answer:
 - Common weapons will be generic ('Steel' instead of 'Steel Sword')
 - Special / Unique weapons can be locked to a slot only usable by their class

 -- Class Skills
 Issue: Class sprites have static weapons drawn (e.g. knight has a sword). This limits skill animation pool for classes
 Answer:
 - Each class has a generic cast and channel animation so magic is OK
 - For missile vs slash/bash skills:
    -- default to restricting to class weapons
    -- abundance of buff effects that allow cross-weapon skilling. examples:
        --- Bow users can shoot blades for melee slash skills
        --- Sword uses can conjure throwing weapons for bow skills
        --- Mages can use magic arrows/throwing knives
